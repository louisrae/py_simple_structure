## About The Project

I created this project to simplify greenfield projects for myself. This is an alternative to simply opening a new file, and gives some level of structure right off the bat. Cookie Cutter templates are great, but usually complex. This is exactly what I need to start a project

Here's why:

- I have one file that I can run code for, keeping imports correct at all times
- It is quick to run, and no need to install anything so I can use it frequently
- I can standardize my projects and keep iterating on my defaults

### Built With

- [Python](url)

## Features

Create a basic python project with sensible default folders
Easy way for beginners to start organizing code
Standardize projects
